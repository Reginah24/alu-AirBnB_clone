This project is my own version of the AirBnB clone for ALU.

## What this project is about
I built a basic version of AirBnB using Python. It comes with a command-line interface that lets you create, show, update, and delete different objects like users, places, and more.

## How to run it
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your computer.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run this command:
   ```
   python console.py
   ```

## How it works
When you see `(hbnb)` in your terminal, you can type commands such as:
- `create User`
- `show User <id>`
- `destroy User <id>`
- `all User`
- `update User <id> name "John"`
- `quit` (to exit)

## Example usage
```
(hbnb) create User
(hbnb) show User 1234-5678
(hbnb) all User
(hbnb) quit
```
