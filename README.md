# alu-AirBnB_clone

This is a simple clone of the AirBnB project for ALU.

## Description
This project is about building a basic version of AirBnB using Python. It has a command line interpreter to manage different objects like users, places, and more.

## How to start
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Open a terminal and run:
   ```
   python console.py
   ```

## How to use
When you see the prompt `(hbnb)`, you can type commands like:
- `create User`
- `show User <id>`
- `destroy User <id>`
- `all User`
- `update User <id> name "John"`
- `quit` to exit

## Example
```
(hbnb) create User
(hbnb) show User 1234-5678
(hbnb) all User
(hbnb) quit
```
